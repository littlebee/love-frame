    """
        Renderables is a container for renderable entities.

        A renderable entity is a python object that has:

        - a `render` method (required).  `render` recieves one argument and should
          return `True` to indicate that it should continue to be called.  A non-truthy
          return will cause the Renderables container to remove the renderable
          item from being rendered.  It is passed the epoch time in seconds (time.time())
          for reliable animations.

        - a `handle_pyg_event` method (optional).  `handle_pyg_event` recieves one
          argument which is the PyGame event.  `handle_pyg_event` should return `True`
          to indicate that it has handled the event and earlier added renderables should
          not have their `handle_pyg_event` called.  In effect, returning false will
          stop propagation

        - a `close` method (optional).  After recieving close(), the renderable should
          return false from its `render` method to indicate it has closed.

        Note that by the above definition, `Renderables` container class defined herein
        is also a renderable entity.  Meaning you can have a renderable entity that is
        a composite from other renderable entities.
